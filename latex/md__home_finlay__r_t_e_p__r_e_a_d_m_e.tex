A repository to demomstrate the use of a Raspberry Pi in controlling a video game with realtime E\+MG signals. This is part of a course hosted by the University of Glasgow in Real Time Embedded Programming.

The repository describes how to measure E\+MG signals from the user\textquotesingle{}s bicep and/or ticep muscles, and how these are then used in turn to control the movement of a paddle in the classic game Pong \+:ping\+\_\+pong\+:(the principles being completely transferrable to other relatively rudimentary games).

\doxysection*{Premise}

The simplest video games have very limited inputs. For some this is simply left/right, while for others it may be up/down/left/right. This makes it relatively straightforward to hack these inputs to be controlled by E\+MG signals (one muscle controls left, another right, etc). With a 4 channel system, we hope to be able to accomodate single-\/player versions of games requiring 4 input options, or multiplayer versions of games requiring only 2 (a safe outlet for any pent up testosterone!).

The primary use of this system is to increase the level of submersion the player feels within the gaming environment, providing a new challenge, and adding a new dimension to the gaming experience. The system also has potential application in the field of rehabilitation, encouraging persistence with otherwise unpleasent rehabilitation regimes.

\doxysection*{E\+MG Measurement \+:muscle\+:}

Here we provide a description of the methods that should be employed in measuring user E\+MG. In light of the recent Covid-\/19 outbreak, the hardware components of this project remain incomplete and as such sample E\+MG data was instead obtained using a U\+S\+B-\/\+D\+UX and bioamplifier for software testing purposes. The acquired E\+MG data has been deposited in Gitlab, and can be found through the link below, along with an example Python script for filtering and plotting.

Standard Ag/\+Ag\+Cl electrodes should be place approximately 20cm apart on the chosen muscle(s). In our case, measuring 4 channels, this required a pair of electrodes on each bicep and a pair on each tricep, with a further electrode attached to the ankle to act as ground (9 total). For a 2 channel approach, any 2 pairs of electrodes may be discounted, leaving 5 total.

Had the hardware components been completed, these signals would be sent through a two stage amplifer, the first a differential stage and the second a gain stage. The output from the amplifier is sent to an A\+DC (A\+D\+S1115) and passed to a Raspberry Pi via the I2C bus protocol for post-\/processing and game connection. Using the sample E\+MG data, the amplifification stage was subverted, applying directly to the A\+DC component. ~\newline


\doxysection*{Progress}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} A P\+CB using the A\+D7705 has been produced to read an artificial stream of data. This will allow data handling to be explored while fabricating and testing components associated with acquiring E\+MG data.
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} Through use of the QT toolkit, a realtime plotting script has been tested. It is thought that presenting this to the user as a form of biofeedback could act as an effective means of encouragement.
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} The A\+DC for the E\+MG recording has been selected as the A\+D\+S1115, and is being implemented into a custom P\+CB with 4 channel inputs. The specifications of the A\+D\+S1115 can be found through the link below\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} The P\+CB using the A\+D\+S1115 now detects data in realtime from 1 channel using I2C. This single channel data can be used in the game (Pong), transferring data using the U\+DP and displaying on android devices, and responds to changes in input to the A\+DC
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Apply prerecorded E\+MG data to the A\+DC to control the game
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Apply live incoming E\+MG data to control the game
