High speed continous driver of \mbox{\hyperlink{classads1115}{ads1115}}

To control the \mbox{\hyperlink{classads1115}{ads1115}} to read at $>$400hz, the ads driver should control \mbox{\hyperlink{classads1115}{ads1115}} in continous mode However, there is no existed \mbox{\hyperlink{classads1115}{ads1115}} continous lib in C++ found so I write this Q\+T/\+C++ one no need to write config every time before every reading, thus time interval can go beneath 2ms 2020-\/03-\/19

2020-\/03-\/21 This is the unit tested version of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classads1115}{ads1115}} driver modification to previous intro There is no \mbox{\hyperlink{classads1115}{ads1115}} continuous mode library in c++, but there is another python lib And another C code is found which is not yet object oriented but a demo and also continuous mode unit test video \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBgsSWfQyrE}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+youtube.\+com/watch?v=a\+Bgs\+S\+Wf\+QyrE}} unit test -\/ conversion ready signal/interrupt \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4weTT-E-Fw}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+youtube.\+com/watch?v=\+M4we\+T\+T-\/\+E-\/\+Fw}}
